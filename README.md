# Introduction
## With over 45,000 students at UIUC, places of interest on campus often get busy. Students don’t want to waste time walking around campus looking for spots to study, workout, eat, or hangout. 
# Our Solution: UIU-Seats
## UIU-Seats, allows students to check and log the activity level of popular spots on campus from the comfort of their home.
General Functionality:
1. Users can provide their own input by rating the current activity level at the four locations (Union, Grainger, Cafe Bene, ARC) as empty, neutral, or busy. 
2. Users can view the current busyness level of a given location as either a percent out of 100 or a qualitative rating of empty, neutral, or busy.
